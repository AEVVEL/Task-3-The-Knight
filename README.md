# Task-3-The-Knight

I am a student at Unit Factory. The ls function was my twin project with Novotorsky Arthur. It was originally written under Mac OS, so some functions do not work as on linux, for example, sorting files on output. My project has more functionality than asking for the task, so I decided to send it by porting it to Linux.
